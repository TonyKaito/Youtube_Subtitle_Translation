# Youtube_Subtitle_Translation

WIP
Get the Data (Get transcripts)
Clean the Data (Parse by word, clean each word into word stem, attach part of speech)
Rank order each word into TF-IDF/Word Frequency
Pick out Top 20 words and their parts of speech (above a certain threshhold, if not, do not add even if less than 20)
Translate

-> Maybe add to Anki with image?
